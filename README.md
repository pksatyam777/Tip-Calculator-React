CREATE REACT APP
INSTRUCTIONS:-</br>
As a restaurant owner, I want to calculate the total tip offered by various customer according to their
experience.
For example, if the experience is excellent and the total bill of the customer is 2000
The total tip would be 20% of 2000 i.e. 400 Rs. You need to show Customer Name and the tip amount
400 as an output for each customer.

OBJECTIVES:-</br>

1. Create a bill amount field.
2. Create a text input for entering the name of the customers.
3. Create a select tag for service rating, based on the rating the tip amount will be calculated
and displayed.
for example:
total bill amount: 2000
Service 1: excellent (20%)
Service 2: Moderate (10%)
Service 3: bad (5%)
4. Tip from customer 1: (2000) * 20% - Customer tip - 400 Rs
Tip from customer 2: (2500) * 10% - Customer tip - 250 Rs
Tip from customer 3: (5000) * 5% - Customer tip - 250 Rs
5. When customer clicks on Add customer button after filling the details, calculate and
display the tip for the customer and add the details to the output area dynamically.
6. Add a Calculate button to view total customers and total tip paid.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
